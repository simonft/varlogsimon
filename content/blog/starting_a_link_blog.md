Last Friday was my last day at the Federal Trade Commission. While I was there I would frequently share interesting blog posts and articles via an FTC-internal newsletter the Office of Technology sent out and in team-internal Microsoft Teams channels, eventually leading others to start referring to "Simon's depressing article of the day". Surprisingly, this is an activity people have expressed interest in me continuing outside the FTC. 

So, inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), [Andy Baio](https://waxy.org/), [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/content/bookmarkedpages), and [Kellan Elliott-McCrea](https://laughingmeme.org/2024/06/08/a-link-blog-in-2024.html), I'm going to experiment with a [link blog of my own](@/links/_index.md) (in addition to a regular blog).

The theme will be things I find interesting, with an emphasis on blog posts or reporting I feel comfortable evaluating the strength of, where I feel I have something I can add, and that are less likely to be posted to other link blogs. This probably means mostly privacy, security, and other tech-heavy topics.

The first link is [Strava Bans User for Running in North Korea](@/links/strava_bans_user_running_north_korea.md) and there are RSS feeds for [the link blog](/links/atom.xml), [the regular blog](/blog/atom.xml), and [everything](/atom.xml).
